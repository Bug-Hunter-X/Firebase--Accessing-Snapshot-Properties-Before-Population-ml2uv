The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has been fully populated. This can happen if you're using asynchronous operations and trying to access the data before the promise has resolved. For example, if you're listening to real-time updates using `onSnapshot`, you might try to access a property of the document before the `onSnapshot` callback has been executed.
